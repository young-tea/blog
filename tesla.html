                <h4>Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and remains the most valuable automaker in the world with a market
                cap of nearly $1 trillion. The company had the most sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles,
                capturing 16% of the plug-in market and 23% of the battery-electric market. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in
                the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems.</h4>

                <h2 class="zag"><strong>Founding</strong></h2>

                <h4>The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Eberhard
                and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively. Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is
                also a technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary
                motor".<br><br>
                
                Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later. In February 2004, the company raised $7.5 million
                in series A funding, including $6.5 million from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest
                in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of
                Tesla.</h4>

                <div class="margin-7"></div>

                <h2 class="zag"><strong>Finances</strong></h2>

                <h4>For the year 2020, Tesla reported a net income of $721 million, the company's first annual
                profit (all years before 2020 wasnt profitable). The annual revenue was $31.5 billion, an increase of 28% over the previous fiscal year. <br><br>
                
                Tesla ended 2020 with over $19 billion of cash on hand after having raised approximately $12 billion in stock sales. <br><br>
                
                Tesla makes significant revenue from selling regulatory credits to other manufacturers. Various governments issue
                the credits to battery electric vehicle automakers based on the maker's sales volume, which in turn can be sold to other
                makers who need credits to offset their sales volume of internal combustion engine vehicles. In 2020, Tesla earned
                $1.6 billion from such sales, without which it would have had a net loss in 2020. <br><br>
                
                In February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and
                the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. Critics then pointed out how investing in
                cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals. Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment
                than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was
                announced.</h4>
