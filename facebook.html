                                California. The company is the parent organization of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, among other subsidiaries.
                                Meta is one of the world's most valuable companies and is considered one of the Big Tech companies in U.S. information
                                technology, alongside Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. The company generates a substantial share of its revenue
                                from the sale of advertisement placements to marketers.

                <h4>Meta offers other products and services, including Facebook, Messenger, Facebook Watch, and Facebook Portal. It has also
                acquired Oculus, Giphy and Mapillary, and has a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms. <br><br>
                
                In October 2021, media outlets reported that the parent company of Facebook planned to change its name to "reflect its
                focus on building the metaverse"; it was rebranded as Meta later that month on October 28. <br><br> 
                The word "meta"
                comes from the Greek language and means "beyond", indicating the futuristic motive.</h4>

                <h2 class="zag"><strong>History</strong></h2>

                <h4>Facebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on January 1, 2012. The preliminary prospectus stated that the
                company sought to raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7 billion likes and
                comments daily. <br><br>
                
                Trading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the NASDAQ
                exchange. The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back
                shares to support the price. At closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23, only $0.23 above the IPO price and
                down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment. <br><br>
                
                On May 22, 2012, regulators from Wall Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to
                investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than
                the general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue. <br><br>
                
                Standard & Poor's added Facebook to its S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013. <br><br>
                
                On May 2, 2014, Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from "Move fast and break
                things" to "Move fast with stable infrastructure". The earlier motto had been described as Zuckerberg's "prime
                directive to his developers and team" in a 2009 interview in Business Insider, in which he also said, "Unless you are
                breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough." <br><br>
                
                In 2018, Oculus lead Jason Rubin sent his 50-page vision document titled The Metaverse to Facebook's leadership. In the
                document, Rubin acknowledges that Facebook's virtual reality business didn't catch on as expected, despite the hundreds
                of millions of dollars spent on content for early adopters. He also urged the company to execute fast and go big on the
                vision, to shut out HTC, Apple, Google and other competitors in the VR space. Regarding other players' participation in
                the metaverse vision, he wrote: “Let’s build the Metaverse to keep them from being in the VR business in a meaningful
                way at all.” <br><br>
                
                In May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks, reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency. In recent
                developments it has been reported that Libra is being supported by financial companies like Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and
                Uber. The consortium of companies is expected to pool in $10 million each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin
                named Libra. Depending on when it receives approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate
                as a payments service, the Libra Association plans to launch a limited format cryptocurrency in 2021.</h4>

                <h2 class="zag"><strong>Finances</strong></h2>

                <h4>Facebook ranked No. 34 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue, with almost
                $86 billion in revenue. Most comes from advertising. One analysis of 2017 data determined that the company
                earned US$20.21 per user from advertising. <br><br>
                
                In February 2015, Facebook announced it had reached two million active advertisers, with most of the gain coming from
                small businesses. An active advertiser was defined as an entity that had advertised on the Facebook platform in the last
                28 days. <br><br>
                
                In March 2016, Facebook announced it had reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from
                outside the United States. <br><br>
                
                Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on auctioning ad
                placements, and potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself. Similar to other online advertising platforms
                like Google and Twitter, targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of digital advertising compared to
                traditional media. Marketing on Meta is employed through two methods based on the viewing habits, likes and shares, and
                purchasing data of the audience, namely targeted audiences and "look alike" audiences.</h4>
