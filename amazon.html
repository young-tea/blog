                <h2 class="zag"><strong>Founding</strong></h2>

                <h4>Jeff Bezos founded Amazon from his garage in Bellevue, Washington, on July 5, 1994. It started as an online
                marketplace for books but expanded to sell electronics, software, video games, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and
                jewelry. In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market
                capitalization. In August 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for US$13.4 billion, which substantially
                increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[15] In 2018, its two-day delivery service, Amazon Prime, surpassed 100
                million subscribers worldwide.</h4>

                <div class="margin-7"></div>

                <h2 class="zag"><strong>Products</strong></h2>

                <h4>Amazon.com's product lines available at its website include several media (books, DVDs, music CDs, videotapes and
                software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and
                personal-care items, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical
                instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items and toys & games. <br><br>
                In August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco, CA as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city. Amazon has separate
                retail websites for some countries and also offers international shipping of some of its products to certain other
                countries. <br><br> 
                In November 2020, the company started an online delivery service dedicated to prescription drugs. The
                service provides discounts up to 80% for generic drugs and up to 40% for branded drugs for Prime subscribe users. The
                products can be purchased on the company's website or at over 50,000 bricks-and-mortar pharmacies in the United
                States.</h4>

                <div class="margin-7"></div>

                <h2 class="zag"><strong>Finances</strong></h2>
                
                <h4>Amazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of
                each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be
                listed as featured products. As of 2018, Amazon.com is ranked 8th on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United
                States corporations by total revenue. <br><br>
                
                For the fiscal year 2018, Amazon reported earnings of US$10.07 billion, with an annual revenue of US$232.887 billion, an
                increase of 30.9% over the previous fiscal cycle. Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835 billion to 232.887 billion,
                thanks to continued business expansion. <br><br>
                
                Amazon's market capitalization went over US$1 trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth
                quarter 2019 results.</h4>
